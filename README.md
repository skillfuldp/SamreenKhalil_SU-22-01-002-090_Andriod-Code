This is a basic Flutter application that demonstrates the core features of the framework, including state management and UI updates. The app contains a counter that increments each time the user presses the floating action button. It uses a `StatefulWidget` to manage the state of the counter and re-renders the UI whenever the counter value changes. The app is designed with a purple color scheme and a simple structure, making it an excellent starting point for beginners learning how to build interactive mobile apps with Flutter.
